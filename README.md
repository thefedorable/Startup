# Startup
I've used this feature before in another class so I didn't learn to much. However, What I will say is that recently I had a bid of a scare where I thought I lost hours of code (by recent I mean literally the day I'm writing this). So, I learned the importance of constant pushing and pulling and so I'm now making a point to do that.
