# Startup
I've used this feature before in another class so I didn't learn to much. However, What I will say is that recently I had a bid of a scare where I thought I lost hours of code (by recent I mean literally the day I'm writing this). So, I learned the importance of constant pushing and pulling and so I'm now making a point to do that.

/ Elevator pitch/

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an amazing game. All of us have played it and that also mean that all of us have struggled to find all 120 shrines. Maybe you found 110 and just can't quite locate the last few. But, when you try to look it up on the internet you quicly relize you can't remember what shrines you have and haven't found. Well, I'm going to be working on an aplication that not only allows you to track your shrines but also get hints on those last pesky shrines you can't find. You can even link up with friends to see who can finds all 120 first!

/Features/

Shrine tracking, account to store data, Write ups for each shrine with hint, See friends progress, notification when anyone using the app finds all shrines.

I honestly learned so much. At this point I've finally got the grasp of HTMl and so everything felt pretty good. I can't say I'm good at it in the same way
I'm good at c++ but if I have a cheat sheat next to me I think I'll be good. Also, I learned the importance of reading the push script. I chnaged the index 
file to home because I thought that made more since up doing so messed up the push script so yeah, should proabably not do that from now on.

/CSS Simon/

The thing I really learned is that bootstrap and other things like it really streamline design. That isn't to say that css is useless. Color and images are something that css is really amazing at and so know how to use it is still important but most of my styling came from bootstrap since fidiling with css to syle things exactly as I want wasn't my favorite thing. Learning about everything bootstrap can do and using codepen to learn what it can do will be extremly important for my start up.

/JS/

In order for the arrow function to work the way I would want it I need to do something like:
const name = a => a * 100;
That will create a function named name that will take a parameter and multiply 100 to it.

/DOM/

Ulitmatly all this is a way of taking the HTML elements of a website and turning that into an object that your javascript can manipulate. For example, Say we want something to change when we click a button. We use the function: document.getElementById("name").innerHTML = "Tanner Hartwell";. This will find the element that we give the id of name to. Then we use innerHTML to get the text that is being displayed and we can set that equal to whatever we want. It's simple function stuff but instead of creating variables we are basicly using our HTML as the variables.
