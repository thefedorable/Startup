# Startup
I've used this feature before in another class so I didn't learn to much. However, What I will say is that recently I had a bid of a scare where I thought I lost hours of code (by recent I mean literally the day I'm writing this). So, I learned the importance of constant pushing and pulling and so I'm now making a point to do that.

/ Elevator pitch/

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an amazing game. All of us have played it and that also mean that all of us have struggled to find all 120 shrines. Maybe you found 110 and just can't quite locate the last few. But, when you try to look it up on the internet you quicly relize you can't remember what shrines you have and haven't found. Well, I'm going to be working on an aplication that not only allows you to track your shrines but also get hints on those last pesky shrines you can't find. You can even link up with friends to see who can finds all 120 first!

/Features/

Shrine tracking, account to store data, Write ups for each shrine with hint, See friends progress, notification when anyone using the app finds all shrines.

I honestly learned so much. At this point I've finally got the grasp of HTMl and so everything felt pretty good. I can't say I'm good at it in the same way
I'm good at c++ but if I have a cheat sheat next to me I think I'll be good. Also, I learned the importance of reading the push script. I chnaged the index 
file to home because I thought that made more since up doing so messed up the push script so yeah, should proabably not do that from now on.
